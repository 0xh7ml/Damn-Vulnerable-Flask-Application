<h1>What is OWASP?</h1>
<p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an online community that tracks common vulnerabilities and publishes information about web application security.</p>
<p>
The <a href=https://www.owasp.org>OWASP</a> site is a treasure trove of information about web application security and vulnerability research. However, since information is kept in a somewhat-jumbled wiki format, it can take a while to find what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Each year OWASP publishes the list of the most common security vulnerabilities. If you read one thing on OWASP each year, it should probably be their top ten list.</p>
<h1>What is a vulnerability?</h1>
<p>In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerabilities are also known as the attack surface.</p>
